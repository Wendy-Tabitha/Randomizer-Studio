## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(45, 90%, 50%) - Golden Yellow (#FACC15). Evokes feelings of optimism, energy, and creativity, complementing the app's fun and utilitarian nature. The golden yellow aims for a balanced visual impact without overwhelming the user.
- Background color: HSL(45, 20%, 95%) - Off-White (#FDF8EE). Provides a soft, neutral backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain, enabling prolonged use of the application's tools.
- Accent color: HSL(15, 80%, 50%) - Coral (#F2542D). It contrasts effectively with the golden yellow and off-white, drawing the user's attention to calls-to-action and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use minimalist and clear icons, providing an intuitive understanding of each randomizer tool. Icons should match the chosen color palette.
- Employ a responsive, grid-based layout to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices. Each tool should have its own clearly defined area.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting animations (e.g., a smooth transition or loading animation) when randomizing, enhancing the user's sense of delight without interrupting the experience.
